                <div class="stater2"><h4><div class="title">Test Architect</div>  <div class="company">Stater</div> <div class="data">(08/2023 – 03/2024)</div></h4><p> Stater NV is a subsidiary of Infosys and ABN Amro. In the Test Automation Enablement team there was not enough knowledge and experience to set out a test vision and also to execute it <br>
                    My assignment was to perform an analysis and set up POC of several test tools within the Stater environment. I performed POCs for 3 test tools: Playwright, Cypress.io and Robot framework in Docker containers. Playwright, Cypress.io and Robot framework were placed in a separate repository in azure Devops. Everything was documented in confluence. In addition, I also performed hands-on
                    workshops on Docker and Robot framework. <br>
                    The Test Automation Enablement team now has more hands-on knowledge and experience of Docker and Robot
                    framework. They have 3 POCs with testing tools in Docker and a recommendation for the future based on the
                    target architecture within Stater.

                <div class="cak"><h4>DevOps Test Engineer  - CAK (07/2022 – 06/2023)</h4><p>At the CAK, they needed a DevOps tester with experience in Robot Framework and API testing for a migration project. The APIs were built using a low-code development language (MuleSoft). I joined a team consisting of 6 DevOps API engineers and 4 testers. The testing framework was built using Robot Framework, Postman, CI/CD in Azure and GIT. <br>
                    My responsibilities included ensuring that the new APIs were automatedly tested in Robot Framework, primarily focusing on API testing and some frontend testing. I performed the following tests: integration testing on the testing environment, chain testing on the acceptance environment, and assisting with acceptance testing on the production environment. Additionally, I worked on improving the CI/CD process for testing and troubleshooting test agent (server) issues across CAK. <br>
                    I worked with the following languages and tools: VS Code, Swagger, Postman, Robot Framework, GIT, Azure DevOps, and Python.
                    We automated the tests for the new APIs, we migrated using Robot Framework, also introduced some CI/CD protocols and code princinpals.
                    </p></div>
                    
                <div class="achmea"><h4>Testautomation Engineer - Achmea (01/2022 – 06/2022)</h4><p>At Achmea Centraal Beheer, they required a DevOps tester with expertise in SpecFlow and API testing. I joined a project team consisting of 3 DevOps backend engineers. The testing framework was built using C#.NET, SpecFlow, SwaggerUI, Postman, and GIT. <br>
                    My responsibilities included automating user stories in the test framework. These tasks involved API testing and updating the test framework to enable fully automated regression testing. <br>I utilized the following languages and tools: Visual Studio 2019, Swagger, Postman, SpecFlow, GIT, Azure DevOps and in an Angular JavaScript environment.
                    We updated the tests for the user stories we worked on within the Test framework.
                    </p></div>

                <div class="ictu"><h4>DevOps Test Engineer - ICTU (04/2021 – 12/2021)</h4><p>At ICTU, a tester was needed for a new project for the Ministry of OCW to join the DevOps team, which consisted of 3 full-stackers, 1 front-end engineer, and 1 test engineer. <br>The main responsibilities were to devise and execute the test strategy and automate the tests for the project. The team is developing a web application using Python, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL.
                    My tasks included automating user stories in Robot Framework and taking on the role of test architect to set up the test framework and make key decisions. The test automation covered both UI testing (initially using Selenium library and later switched to Playwright library) and API testing. I also ensured that these tests were integrated into the CI/CD process and contributed to the overall test strategy. Additionally, I managed and optimized Docker test containers, created test data (initially in SQL and later in JSON), performed code reviews and collaborated with the Product Owner to ensure the tests aligned with the requirements. <br>
                    The languages and tools I worked with include Python, PostgreSQL, Robot Framework, GIT, Github, Jenkins, Docker, Ubuntu, Pycharm, Vue.js, JavaScript, Postman, and Jira.
                    The foundation of the Robot Framework is stable, and the tests are executed with every build. Code cannot be pushed to the Master branch unless all tests pass successfully.
                    </p></div>

                <div class="allshare"><h4>Software Testautomation Engineer - Allshare (08/2020 – 03/2021)</h4><p>At Allshare, a subsidiary of Van Lanschot en Kempen, the focus is on developing software for banks. A position was available for a test automation engineer in the test management team, working on a project that deals with back-office software for securities. Allshare operates in a C#.NET environment with Azure. <br>
                    My responsibilities included writing and stabilizing Postman and JMeter tests. Occasionally, I collaborated with one of the four teams, where I was involved in testing user stories related to the securities part of the banking process. Initially, I performed manual testing for these user stories and later created Postman tests that became part of the automated regression test suite. Another aspect of my role was providing guidance to the teams based on the test strategy. <br>
                    The languages and tools I worked with include C#, Azure, GIT, Postman, JMeter, Fiddler, JavaScript, MS SQL, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, and Confluence. The automated tests were set up more stably, contributing to a higher quality and more stable product, and reducing the time required for regression testing.

                <div class="abn"><h4>DevOps Test Engineer - ABN AMRO (06/2019 – 09/2019)</h4><p>At ABN AMRO in the CISO domain, there was a need for a DevOps Engineer in Test. The department was working on a product focused on preventing fraudulent transactions by scoring each transaction. The team consisted of 6 multidisciplinary developers with a strong database background, 2 Java developers, and me as the tester. The department is being phased out and replaced by another tool. <br>
                    My tasks included writing tests in their custom-built Java framework and maintaining existing tests based on user stories. I also analyzed the regression test results for the next day and communicated any issues to the developers. Additionally, I created documentation (process flows) based on user stories and verified this against the PostgreSQL functions. <br>
                    The languages and tools used in this role include JAVA, IntelliJ, PostgreSQL, Pgadmin, Subversion, JMeter, Jenkins, Jira, and Confluence.
                    I maintained the test framework, ensuring that new user stories were tested and added to the existing regression suite to keep the fraud prevention system up to date.
                    </p></div>

                <div class="dreizen2"><h4>Software Testautomation Engineer - D-Reizen (11/2018 – 05/2019)</h4><p>At D-Reizen, part of the D-RT Group, there were initially 2 Scrum teams with ambitions to expand to 4 teams. However, the expansion plan was reversed by the management in December. One of the two Scrum teams had an immediate need for a tester. D-Reizen operates in a C#.NET environment with Azure. <br>
                    Initially, the assignment was supposed to last until the formation of 4 teams, but due to financial figures, this changed. The team I were part of was responsible for the new booking process.
                    My tasks involved taking the lead in the testing process and creating UI (Selenium) and API (Postman) tests within the agile team. Collaborating with the other tester to establish the test strategy to achieve Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment/Continuous Testing (CI/CD/CT). Assisting the Product Owner in writing user stories following the Specification by Example method. Encouraging the team to work on the CI/CD process in Azure. Writing tests for cross-browser and cross-device compatibility. Running regression tests on the acceptance and production environments to facilitate the go-live process. <br>
                    The C#.NET framework environment I worked in utilized the following tools: TFS CI/CD, GIT/Sourcetree, Selenium, NUnit3, Visual Studio Test, Postman, Swagger, J-Meter, Sitecore (CMS), MS SQL Server, Visual Studio, Vue.js, JavaScript, and VS Code. I also used Gulp, NPM, and Node.js for running a local environment.
                    With my team, I made adjustments to the test framework to enable running a specific regression test set every night. Additionally, I created UI tests in Selenium/C# for the new booking process, API tests in Postman for the same, and measured the performance of the new API using JMeter. I also focused on improving the quality of user stories.
                    </p></div>

                <div class="stater"><h4>Software Testautomation Engineer - Stater (05/2018 – 10/2018)</h4><p>At Stater NV, a subsidiary of ABN Amro, strategic and team-level goals have been set to enhance test automation efforts.
